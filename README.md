ðŸ’¼ BUSINESS USE CASE - 
# Use Case Title:
AI-Powered Music Analyzer for Audio Intelligence and Metadata Extraction
# Industry:
Music Technology / Audio Engineering / AI-Powered Media Tools
# Use Case:
Music streaming platforms, audio engineers, and content creators often need automated tools to understand the musical and structural properties of audio files â€” such as tempo, key, rhythm complexity, and pitch characteristics. This tool uses AI and signal processing to extract musical metadata and visualize features for quality control, content tagging, music recommendation, or creative insights.

# Project Title:
ðŸŽµ AI Music Analyzer â€“ Interactive Audio Intelligence with Streamlit
________________________________________
# Description:
An AI-powered web application that analyzes uploaded music files (MP3 or WAV) and generates detailed musical insights such as tempo, key, loudness, brightness, percussiveness, and chroma energy. The application visualizes the waveform, spectrogram, and chroma energy, and allows exporting results to JSON for downstream usage in recommendation systems, music indexing, or creative applications.

#  Key Responsibilities (Developer Perspective):
â€¢	âœ… Designed and built an end-to-end Streamlit web app for music analysis.
â€¢	âœ… Integrated librosa for advanced audio feature extraction and signal processing.
â€¢	âœ… Created visualizations for waveform, spectrogram, and chroma energy.
â€¢	âœ… Implemented chroma-based key estimation using pitch class profiles.
â€¢	âœ… Enabled export of metadata and musical features to structured JSON.
â€¢	âœ… Added background theming and a responsive UI using Streamlit customization

#  Packages Used:
